This repository is a collection of code examples demonstrating how to build serverless applications using TypeScript and Azure. Each recipe is a standalone sample that demonstrates how to build a specific feature or use a specific technology. You can use these samples as a starting point for your own projects or to learn more about serverless development with Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> **What's Serverless?**<br>
> Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without managing infrastructure. You can focus on your code and let the cloud provider handle the rest. Azure provides a wide range of serverless services, including [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript), [Azure Static Web Apps]([Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/), and more.

## Why serverless?

Let's say you're a developer for the Contoso Solutions company, and you've been tasked to build new applications with a fast turnaround time, startup style. You need to build these apps quickly with a low initial budget, and you don't want to worry about managing servers, scaling, or infrastructure. **You want to focus on writing code and delivering value to your users.**

*This is exactly where serverless is a great fit!*

While walking through this collection of ready-to-use code examples, you'll learn how to solve common problems and build applications using many of the serverless technologies available on Azure. The best part? You only need to pay attention to the code and the business logic, all samples are ready to deploy and run in your Azure account.

## Prerequisites
- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) to get free Azure credits to get started. If you're a student, you can also get free credits with [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/azureforstudents).
- **GitHub account**. If you don't have one, you can [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). You can optionally use [GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/features/copilot) to help you write code and ship your application even faster.

## Getting started

There are multiple ways to get started with this project.

The quickest way is to use [GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces) that provides a preconfigured environment for you. Alternatively, you can [set up your local environment](#use-your-local-environment) following the instructions below.

<details open>
<summary><h3>Use GitHub Codespaces</h3></summary>

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=blue&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript?hide_repo_select=true&ref&quickstart=true)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Use a VSCode dev container</h3></summary>

A similar option to Codespaces is VS Code Dev Containers, that will open the project in your local VS Code instance using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed on your machine to run the container.

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Use your local environment</h3></summary>

You need to install following tools to work on your local machine:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) _(for Windows users only)_
  - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.
  - Instead of Powershell, you can also use Git Bash or WSL to run the Azure Developer CLI commands.
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=macos%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-javascript) _(should be installed automatically with NPM, only install manually if the API fails to start)_

Then you can get the project code:

1. [**Fork**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript/fork) the project to create your own copy of this repository.
2. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Local** tab, and copy the URL of your forked repository.

   ![Screenshot showing how to copy the repository URL](./docs/images/clone-url.png)
3. Open a terminal and run this command to clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`

</details>

## Run the samples

After setting up your environment, you can deploy and run any of the samples. Each sample is a standalone project that you can run independently. Follows these steps to run a sample:

```bash
# Open the sample directory
cd samples/<sample-name>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy the sample to Azure
azd auth login
azd up
```

Once the initial deployment is completed, you can also run the sample locally with `npm start`.
You can check the `README.md` file in each sample directory for more specific instructions.
